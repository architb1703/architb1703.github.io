Hi, I'm Archit Bansal, a machine learning researcher with a background in Electrical Engineering (B.Tech, IIT Kanpur) and industry experience at Goldman Sachs and Cisco. My academic research experience spans across various domains, like reinforcement learning, NLP and computer vision. Currently, I work as a quantitative strategist at Goldman Sachs, developing statistical models for market risk modelling. Beyond research, I share my learnings through blog posts and hands-on projects, with the goal of bridging theory and practice in AI.
